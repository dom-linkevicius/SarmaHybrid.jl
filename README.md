# SarmaHybrid

This repository aims to implement a scientific machine learning model in a scenario where only parts of the system (in terms of variables and variable interactions) are known. The test case chosen fr thsi approach is a MAPK cascade model by [Sarma and Ghosh (2012)](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/287). The repository contains an implementation of their model (currently only S2, S1 to be implemented later) and a hybrid version of the same model where some intermediate species are taken out, see Figure 1 below.
